        Musk has not only publicly expressed concerns about the extinction of humanity, [3] he has also proposed solutions, some of which are the main objective of his companies and are already being done in practice. Among them, are the reduction of global warming, through the use of renewable energies, a multiplanetary project, more specifically the colonization of Mars, [4] and the safe development of artificial intelligence.

        In January 2011, one of its companies, SpaceX, became the first company in the world to sell a commercial flight to the Moon. The mission, scheduled for 2013, was contracted by the company Astrobotic Technology, aiming to place a small jeep on the lunar surface, which didn't happen. In 2012, he completed the Tesla Roadster project, the first model of his own, a fully electric car that cost about 92 thousand dollars. Currently, Tesla has launched three more models: S, X and Model 3, the latter with the responsibility of bringing electric cars to the masses, starting at an initial cost of $ 35,000.
